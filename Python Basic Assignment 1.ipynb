    "An expression is a combination of operators and operands that is interpreted to produce some other value. an expression is evaluated as per the precedence of its operators.So that if there is more than one operator in an expression, their precedence decides which operation will be performed first. We have many different types of expressions in Python\n",

    "x = 40\n",
    "y = 12\n",
    "  \n",
    "add = x + y\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Integral Expressions: These are the kind of expressions that produce only integer results after all computations and type conversions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Floating Expressions: These are the kind of expressions which produce floating point numbers as result after all computations and type conversions\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Relational Expressions: In these types of expressions, arithmetic expressions are written on both sides of relational operator (> , < , >= , <=). Those arithmetic expressions are evaluated first, and then compared as per relational operator and produce a boolean output in the end. These expressions are also called Boolean expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Logical Expressions: These are kinds of expressions that result in either True or False. It basically specifies one or more conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Bitwise Expressions: These are the kind of expressions in which computations are performed at bit level\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Combinational Expressions: We can also use different types of expressions in a single expression, and that will be termed as combinational expressions.\n"
